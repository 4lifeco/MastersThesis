### ABSTRACT

The relationship between arms trafficking and political violence has emerged as a critical issue in the study of security and governance in Central and South America. This thesis examines the impact of the presence of arms on various forms of violence, including general violence, conflict violence, and political violence, in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, French Guiana, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela from 1990 to 2020. By using, an exploratory and descriptive approach combined with multiple regression models, this study seeks to understand the extent to which arms trafficking influences the prevalence and nature of violent events. Data is collected from reputable sources such as SIPRI, UNROCA, UCDP, PRIO, ACLED, and CPJ, covering a comprehensive range of violent incidents and arms imports. The results indicate that an increase in the importation of major (and to a lesser extent small) arms is significantly correlated with heightened levels of political violence and insecurity. This suggests that the proliferation of arms serves as a catalyst for violence, complicating efforts to maintain political stability and public safety in the region.
